        <h2>My Goals in this Program</h2>
        <p>
          My main goal in the HNG Internship is to sharpen my technical skills,
          improve my problem-solving ability, and build confidence working on
          real-world projects with other developers.

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas I Want to Improve</h2>
        <p>
          I sometimes hesitate when working with complex JavaScript functions or
          project structures. I want to build more confidence in that area and
          learn better ways to organize my code for clarity and scalability.

          progress adds up — just keep going. Remember how far you’ve come, and
          don’t doubt your growth.
